R scripts reproducing the analysis and plots of the manuscript entitled :

Supervised machine learning outperforms taxonomy-based environmental DNA metabarcoding applied to biomonitoring
Tristan Cordier, Dominik Forster, Yoann Dufresne, Catarina IM Martins, Thorsten Stoeck, Jan Pawlowski

The OTU tables of the five markers are zipped in the data.zip archive, along with the metadata. 
Tested on macOS, but should work on linux or windows, as the plots are done using the pdf library.
